# Summary
echo "=== Summary ==="
echo "Migration deadlock fix validation completed."
echo "This fix addresses the core issue by:"
echo "1. ✅ Splitting user_* table RLS enables from the main migration"  
echo "2. ✅ Adding 2-minute timeouts to prevent indefinite hangs"
echo "3. ✅ Maintaining proper migration execution order"
echo "4. ✅ Preserving existing functionality"
echo "5. ✅ Documenting safe migration patterns"
echo
echo "Expected result: No more CI hangs on user_* table migrations!"
